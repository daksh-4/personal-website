            <p>I was invited to the Bennett Medicines Symposium to talk about my prize-winning research as part of their section on how their tools are being used by the wider academic community. The opportunity to deliver a 5 minute oral presentation and answer questions about my analysis throughout the course of the day was an invaluable opportunity and I have several reflections from my experiences.</p>
            
            <p>The work done by the Bennett Institute is a true testament to the academic community and the power of open-source collaboration. The symposium was a reflection of this ethos, with talks from GPs and pharmacists using OpenPrescribing tools to champion change in their reflective practices and trusts to the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer for England talking about how data will be utilised in the NHS 10 year plan. When everyone has access to the same data and analytical capabilities, change can happen at all scales. This leads onto another important message of the day: that change and iteration is the end goal. Statistics are an incredibly powerful tool, but must serve the context and be followed up with plans and communication to direct new guidelines or educate. What excites me most is that the NHS now has access to the same data-driven workflows that have transformed other sectors. There were talks throughout the day from clinicians, pharmacists and representatives from startups all describing how this transformation is taking place.</p>
            
            <p>As a younger researcher, I feel I have gained a lot from this project. Firstly, noticing a trend, thinking of how to investigate it and exploring the impact of my findings fed into my curiosity. Normally, I am used to investigating more empirical topics or critically appraising different treatment choices when reading a review paper but peeling back the layers of organisational structure and influence was a different experience. The terrain is less familiar and the methodological pathways undefined. How can you separate the hundreds of factors that may influence the incorporation of a new drug into routine prescribing? I thought this research would be a chance to build up statistics skills to extract p-values and now I am grateful for the symposium to give me an opportunity to take this further. To step into the world of NHS administration and extract an understanding of organisational barriers that can't be appreciated hunched over an R script and a statistics textbook. The questions I received after my presentation came from people working within the system I was analysing. They wanted to know not just what the data showed, but why it mattered, what might explain the patterns and how the findings could inform changes.</p>
            
            <p>What I will carry forward from the day is a clearer understanding of the ecosystem that research sits in. I'm curious about which research questions matter most to the clinicians and patients affected by prescribing decisions, rather than just which questions could return a satisfying analysis. I'm grateful to have contributed to the day and look forward to seeing the future directions of this community.</p>
